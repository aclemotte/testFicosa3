Implementation of a queue of commands using a FIFO scheme, for an Electronic Control Unit. Implement a circular buffer in C language that uses a function SetCommand() for adding commands to the buffer, and another function GetCommand() for extracting them from the buffer. The function SetCommand() shall control buffer if the buffer is full, and in that case shall avoid inserting new commands in the buffer.

Fill the SetCommand and GetCommand functions below. If you need additional variables, create them in Additional variables definition section.
